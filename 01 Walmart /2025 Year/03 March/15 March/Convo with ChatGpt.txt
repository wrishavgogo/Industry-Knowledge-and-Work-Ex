Do you know about netflix hollow cache ?

2/2

ChatGPT said:
Yes! Netflix Hollow is a high-performance in-memory data caching and compression library designed for handling large datasets efficiently while keeping memory usage low. It's different from traditional caches like Redis because it focuses on read-heavy use cases where datasets are rarely modified but frequently queried.

üîπ Key Features of Netflix Hollow
Delta-based Updates

Instead of reloading the entire dataset, Hollow computes and applies only the changes (deltas).
This makes updates super efficient.
Snapshot + Delta Mechanism

Hollow stores snapshots of data in memory.
It then applies incremental deltas to update data without reloading everything.
Memory Efficiency with Deduplication

Hollow eliminates duplicate objects in memory using object pooling.
This saves RAM and improves performance for large datasets.
Immutable Dataset View

Once a dataset is loaded into memory, it never changes (only new versions replace old ones).
This ensures thread safety and enables zero-downtime updates.
Optimized for Read-heavy Workloads

Hollow is designed for high-speed lookups in microservices that serve millions of read requests.
üîπ How Netflix Uses Hollow
User Metadata Caching (Profiles, Preferences, Watch History).
Movie & TV Show Catalogs (Titles, Descriptions, Availability).
Recommendation Systems (Large-scale personalization with fast lookups).
üîπ How is it Different from Redis?

So in my company netflix hollow cache was used . We uploaded the snapshot to azure blob and then we wrote consumers which during startup would do a refresh cache and fetch it . I dont understand how was the snapshot stored in memory . Like was there any encoding to store that large blob data in memory . Also we use java btw just letting you know 
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense! Your system is using Netflix Hollow in a fairly common way:

Snapshot Storage: Uploading the Hollow snapshot to Azure Blob Storage.
Consumer Start-up: On startup, consumers fetch the snapshot and load it into memory.
Refresh Mechanism: Consumers periodically update their cache by fetching incremental deltas.
üîπ How is the Snapshot Stored in Memory?
Hollow stores snapshots efficiently in memory using a compressed object graph. This helps reduce memory footprint while enabling fast lookups. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Encoding & Compression
Netflix Hollow does not store raw JSON or objects in memory. Instead, it:
‚úÖ Uses primitive arrays instead of objects (e.g., int[], long[])
‚úÖ Deduplicates repeated data across objects (string pooling)
‚úÖ Encodes relationships using ordinal references

For example, instead of storing a List of objects, Hollow assigns each object an ordinal number and uses int arrays to link them.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How is Data Structured in Memory?
Hollow uses Field Type Compression to store large datasets in a memory-efficient manner.

Example: If you have a dataset like this:
json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "id": 101, "name": "Alice", "city": "NY" },
  { "id": 102, "name": "Bob", "city": "SF" }
]
Hollow splits and encodes this as:

id ‚Üí stored in a primitive int array ([101, 102])
name ‚Üí stored in a String deduplicated table (["Alice", "Bob"])
city ‚Üí stored as ordinal references ([0, 1] where 0 = "NY", 1 = "SF"`)
This structure eliminates duplicate objects and makes lookups super fast.

3Ô∏è‚É£ How Consumers Load the Snapshot?
When your Java consumer fetches the snapshot, it:
‚úÖ Reads the binary-encoded snapshot from Azure Blob.
‚úÖ Decodes it using Hollow's internal structure (primitive arrays, ordinals, etc.).
‚úÖ Creates a read-only in-memory dataset for fast access.

The snapshot is immutable, meaning each update creates a new dataset version. Deltas (incremental changes) are applied on top of this.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Why is This More Efficient Than Plain Java Objects?
Hollow avoids creating millions of Java objects (which would cause high GC overhead).
Instead, it stores everything as compressed memory-efficient structures using primitive arrays.

üîπ Summary
Hollow compresses and encodes data using ordinal references, string pooling, and primitive arrays.
The snapshot is binary-encoded before being stored in Azure Blob Storage.
Consumers fetch and decode this snapshot into memory using Hollow‚Äôs efficient object model.
Lookups are faster than traditional caching because everything is pre-indexed.

You said:
One question so in memory is the again decoded data stored in memory or something else ?
ChatGPT said:
Great question! No, Hollow does not fully decode the snapshot back into regular Java objects in memory. Instead, it maintains a compressed in-memory representation that is still optimized for fast lookups.

üîπ What Happens After Fetching the Snapshot?
Consumer Fetches the Snapshot from Azure Blob.
Hollow Loads the Data in a Compressed Format using:
Primitive arrays (int[], long[], float[]) instead of objects
Ordinal-based references instead of direct object references
String interning (deduplication) to save memory
Only When You Query the Data, Hollow "Projects" It as Objects
This means Java objects are not eagerly created
They are only created as lightweight views when accessed
üîπ What is Actually Stored in Memory?
Hollow keeps an efficient, read-optimized structure instead of raw objects.
For example, consider this dataset:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "id": 101, "name": "Alice", "city": "NY" },
  { "id": 102, "name": "Bob", "city": "SF" }
]
Instead of storing full Java objects, Hollow stores:

Field	Data Type Stored in Memory
id	int[] ids = {101, 102}
name	String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob"} (pooled)
city	String[] cities = {"NY", "SF"} (pooled)
cityRef	int[] cityRefs = {0, 1} (ordinal-based references)
Here, cityRef[0] = 0 means "NY" and cityRef[1] = 1 means "SF".

So, instead of keeping a Java User object for every record, Hollow stores just the raw data in a structured way.

üîπ How Queries Work?
When you query data, Hollow does not deserialize the entire dataset into objects.
Instead, it creates a lightweight "view" (proxy objects) that refer to the compressed data.
This allows zero GC pressure since no full Java objects are created unless necessary.
üîπ Key Takeaways
‚úÖ The snapshot is stored in compressed format in memory (not as decoded Java objects).
‚úÖ Data is stored in primitive arrays & ordinal references instead of object pointers.
‚úÖ Only lightweight proxy objects are created on-demand for querying.
‚úÖ This reduces memory usage and avoids GC overhead.

This is why Netflix Hollow is so efficient for large-scale caching.

You said:
How does hollow know 0 refers to city NY or SF ?
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Hollow knows that 0 refers to "NY" and 1 refers to "SF" because of ordinal-based indexing. Let me break it down step by step.

üîπ How Hollow Maps Ordinals to Actual Values
Hollow Creates a Unique Pool of Strings (or Objects)

Instead of storing "NY" and "SF" repeatedly for every record, Hollow stores them once in a string pool (or object pool).
Each unique value is assigned an ordinal (index) starting from 0.
Example City Pool (String Array in Memory):

css
Copy
Edit
["NY", "SF"]
"NY" is assigned ordinal 0
"SF" is assigned ordinal 1
Hollow Stores Only Ordinals in the Dataset

Instead of storing full city names, Hollow stores their ordinals (integer references).
This means instead of:
json
Copy
Edit
{ "id": 101, "name": "Alice", "city": "NY" }
Hollow internally stores:
yaml
Copy
Edit
id: 101, name: "Alice", cityRef: 0
When You Query the Data, Hollow Looks Up the Pool

If you ask Hollow for Alice's city:
java
Copy
Edit
user.getCity(); 
Hollow looks up ordinal 0 in the city pool and returns "NY".
üîπ How This Helps?
‚úÖ Reduces memory usage (stores "NY" only once even if 1M users live in NY).
‚úÖ Faster lookups (integer comparison is faster than string comparison).
‚úÖ Zero garbage collection (GC) overhead since Hollow never creates extra objects.

üîπ Example: How Hollow Stores and Queries Data
Let‚Äôs say we have this dataset:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "id": 101, "name": "Alice", "city": "NY" },
  { "id": 102, "name": "Bob", "city": "SF" },
  { "id": 103, "name": "Charlie", "city": "NY" }
]
Hollow will internally store:

Field	Storage in Memory
id	int[] ids = {101, 102, 103}
name	String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}
cityPool	String[] cities = {"NY", "SF"}
cityRef	int[] cityRefs = {0, 1, 0}
Now, if you query Charlie‚Äôs city:

java
Copy
Edit
user.getCity();  // Charlie ‚Üí cityRef[2] ‚Üí cities[0] ‚Üí "NY"
Hollow sees cityRef[2] = 0, checks cities[0], and returns "NY".

üîπ Summary
Hollow assigns each unique value an ordinal (index).
It stores only integer references instead of actual strings/objects.
During queries, Hollow maps the ordinal back to the actual value using its pool.
This is why Hollow is memory-efficient and fast for read-heavy applications! üöÄ







You said:
So is this string pool also stored in snapshot uploaded in the blob ?
ChatGPT said:
Yes! The string pool (or any object pool in Hollow) is included in the snapshot uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.

üîπ How is the String Pool Stored in the Snapshot?
When a producer creates a snapshot, Hollow serializes everything, including:
‚úÖ The actual data records (like user IDs, city references, etc.).
‚úÖ The string pool (or object pool) used for deduplication.

Example: If You Have This Data
json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "id": 101, "name": "Alice", "city": "NY" },
  { "id": 102, "name": "Bob", "city": "SF" },
  { "id": 103, "name": "Charlie", "city": "NY" }
]
The snapshot will store:
1Ô∏è‚É£ City Pool (String Deduplication Table)

css
Copy
Edit
["NY", "SF"] 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Actual Data with Ordinal References

pgsql
Copy
Edit
id: [101, 102, 103]
name: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
cityRef: [0, 1, 0]   // Uses ordinal references
üîπ How Consumers Load the String Pool?
1Ô∏è‚É£ The consumer downloads the snapshot from Azure Blob.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Hollow reconstructs the in-memory object model exactly as it was stored:

It restores the string pool (cities = ["NY", "SF"]).
It restores the ordinal mappings (cityRef = [0, 1, 0]). 3Ô∏è‚É£ Queries are resolved using the in-memory string pool instead of decoding full objects.
üîπ Why Store the String Pool in the Snapshot?
‚úÖ Ensures consistency across all consumers.
‚úÖ Avoids reprocessing or recalculating deduplications at runtime.
‚úÖ Makes snapshots smaller by avoiding duplicate string storage.

üîπ Summary
Yes, the string pool is stored in the snapshot.
When consumers load the snapshot, they restore the pool in memory.
Queries retrieve data using ordinal lookups from this pool.
This reduces memory footprint and improves query speed! üöÄ







You said:
Now how does nested object lets say an object another object which is not primitive how does that mapping happen ?
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Hollow handles nested objects (non-primitive types) using ordinal-based references just like it does for strings, but across different types in the dataset. Let me break it down step by step.

üîπ Example: Nested Object Structure
Let‚Äôs say we have a User object that contains an Address object:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Alice",
  "address": {
    "city": "NY",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
Hollow does not store the full Address object inside User. Instead, it:
‚úÖ Stores a separate pool for Address objects.
‚úÖ Stores an ordinal reference in User instead of the full object.

üîπ How Hollow Stores This in Memory
Hollow will internally create two separate data pools:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User Pool (stores users but refers to Address using an ordinal)

cpp
Copy
Edit
id: [101]
name: ["Alice"]
addressRef: [0]  // Ordinal reference to Address
2Ô∏è‚É£ Address Pool (stores unique addresses)

vbnet
Copy
Edit
city: ["NY"]
zip: ["10001"]
yaml
Copy
Edit
addressOrdinal 0 ‚Üí { city: 0, zip: 0 }
üîπ How Queries Work?
When you access Alice‚Äôs address, Hollow follows the ordinal reference:

java
Copy
Edit
user.getAddress();  // addressRef[0] ‚Üí Address object at index 0
user.getAddress().getCity();  // cityRef[0] ‚Üí "NY"
addressRef[0] points to the first address in the Address pool.
cityRef[0] (inside Address) points to "NY".
So, Alice‚Äôs city is "NY" without ever storing a full Address object in User.
üîπ Summary
Hollow stores each object type in a separate pool (Users, Addresses, etc.).
Nested objects are stored using ordinal references, just like strings.
Queries follow these ordinal references to resolve values without full object deserialization.
This makes Hollow extremely memory-efficient for deeply nested structures.
This structure avoids unnecessary object creation and allows fast lookups with minimal memory overhead! üöÄ







You said:
And you are saying objects are not created but this in memory lookup is pretty fast right ?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, exactly! Hollow does not create Java objects for each record, but the in-memory lookup is still extremely fast. Here's why:

üîπ Why is Hollow's In-Memory Lookup So Fast?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Memory Access Instead of Object Creation

Hollow stores all data in primitive arrays (int[], long[], String[] pools).
Instead of creating an Address object for every User, it just retrieves the relevant indices and looks them up in memory.
No need for Java heap allocation or GC overhead!
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ordinal-Based Navigation

Since objects are referenced via integers (ordinals), lookup is just array indexing, which is O(1) time complexity.
Example: user.getAddress() is just a single integer lookup, like:
java
Copy
Edit
addressPool[addressRef[0]];  // Fetches address at ordinal 0
This is way faster than traditional object creation & pointer dereferencing.
3Ô∏è‚É£ CPU Cache Efficiency

Hollow's data is packed tightly in memory, meaning less cache misses.
This allows fast sequential reads without extra CPU cycles for object allocation.
üîπ Example: Traditional Object vs. Hollow Lookup
üö´ Without Hollow (Traditional Java Objects)
java
Copy
Edit
User user = userRepo.findById(101);
Address address = user.getAddress();
String city = address.getCity();
Each User and Address are full Java objects (causes heap allocations).
JVM does pointer chasing (dereferencing multiple objects in memory).
More GC pressure if there are millions of users.
‚úÖ With Hollow (Ordinal-Based Lookup)
java
Copy
Edit
User user = hollowDataAccess.getUserById(101);
int addressOrdinal = user.getAddressOrdinal();
Address address = hollowDataAccess.getAddressByOrdinal(addressOrdinal);
String city = address.getCity();
No object creation (only integer lookups in arrays).
Fast O(1) array indexing instead of Java pointer traversal.
Significantly reduces memory usage and improves query speed.
üîπ Summary
‚úÖ No full object creation, just array indexing.
‚úÖ Lookups are super fast (O(1) direct memory access).
‚úÖ Avoids garbage collection pressure, leading to better JVM performance.

This makes Hollow ideal for read-heavy systems like Netflix, where fast, memory-efficient data access is critical! üöÄ







You said:
This will obviously perform better than guava cache because 1. There is change of GC and also cache miss and lesser amount of data can be cached 
ChatGPT said:
Yes, exactly! Hollow outperforms Guava Cache (or other traditional in-memory caches) for large-scale datasets because of its efficient memory model and GC avoidance. Here's a direct comparison:

üîπ Why Hollow Performs Better Than Guava Cache
Feature	Guava Cache üö´	Hollow ‚úÖ
Object Creation	Creates full Java objects (causes GC pressure).	Uses ordinal references (no object creation).
Memory Usage	Higher, due to object overhead & fragmentation.	Lower, as data is packed in primitive arrays.
GC Overhead	Frequent GC runs due to object churn.	Almost zero GC (only arrays, no object allocations).
Cache Misses	Cache eviction leads to recalculations or DB hits.	No misses‚Äîall data is always available in memory.
Scalability	Limited by Java heap size & GC efficiency.	Efficiently stores millions of records in memory.
Data Refresh	Cache invalidation is tricky & expensive.	Hollow provides incremental updates (delta-based syncing).
Performance	Slower for large datasets due to cache misses & GC.	Blazing fast O(1) lookups with array indexing.
üîπ Breaking It Down Further
1Ô∏è‚É£ Guava Cache Has Limited Capacity ‚Üí Hollow Can Store More

Guava uses LRU eviction, so it cannot store the entire dataset.
Hollow keeps all data in memory, so every lookup is a hit (no DB calls).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Guava Cache Has GC Pressure ‚Üí Hollow Avoids GC

Guava stores full Java objects, which means:
Objects get allocated & deallocated, increasing GC activity.
More data = more GC pauses & performance issues.
Hollow stores data in primitive arrays, so there‚Äôs no heap fragmentation & no GC churn.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Cache Misses Hurt Guava ‚Üí Hollow Has Zero Misses

Guava evicts entries based on LRU rules, leading to cache misses.
Cache misses force:
Expensive DB queries or recomputations.
Increased latency.
Hollow never evicts data (it keeps everything in memory & syncs with incremental updates).
4Ô∏è‚É£ Hollow Has Fast, Direct Memory Access

Guava Cache: Uses Map<K, V> lookup (hashmap-based, O(1) but with object overhead).
Hollow: Uses ordinal-based lookups (O(1) with zero object allocation).
üîπ Conclusion
‚úÖ Hollow wins when you need to cache large datasets efficiently.
‚úÖ Hollow avoids GC, while Guava suffers from frequent GC pauses.
‚úÖ Hollow avoids cache misses, while Guava has eviction-based misses.
‚úÖ Hollow provides incremental updates, while Guava requires full invalidation.

If your system needs fast, in-memory access to large datasets, Hollow is the way to go!
